Adair

A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband that's true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
And the only home you know is the club down the street.

Dim lights, thick smoke and loud loud music
It's the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man.

A drinkin' and dancin' to a honky-tonk band
Is the only kind of life you'LL ever understand
Go on and have your fun you think you've played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky-tonk heart.

Dim lights, thick smoke and loud loud music
It's the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man.
