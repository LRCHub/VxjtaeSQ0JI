There's nothing more you can leave behind
So forget about seeing, get into your mind
Everything looks better when the world is black
Grab a fork, make the first attack
Lights out!
Poke poke, poke your eyes out
Lights out!
Put a pen in your hand, poke your eyes out
I can't see too well, what's it all about?
Well I dunno man, did you poke your eyes out?
Sure thing, I did it today, startin' to get hip to the lights out way
Lights out!
Poke poke, poke your eyes out
Lights out!
[Put yourself on the floor], roll all about
If you poke too far you reach the front of your brain
Fork in your mind can drive you insane!
Don't worry much, just let it rip, today your eyeballs do the
Lights out trip
Lights out!
Put a pen in your hand, poke your eyes out
Lights out!
Poke poke, poke your eyes out
Lights out!
Put an ax in your head, poke your eyes out!
