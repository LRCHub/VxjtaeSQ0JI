Save me with a kiss
A gentle touch, before the darkness

Lights out
We won't be home tonight
Let the river carry us around the bend

Lights out
We won't be home tonight
Everything is better in the half-light

Lights out
We won't be home tonight
Let the river carry us around the bend

Lights out
We won't be home tonight
Everything is better in the half-light

(Lights out
We won't be home tonight
Everything is bеtter in the half-light)
