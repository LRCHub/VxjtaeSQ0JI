A bright array of city lights
As far as I can see
Their great white wave shines through the night
On lonely guys like me

The cabaret's and honky tonks
The flashing signs and lights
The broken heart to lose itself
In the glow of city lights

Lights that say forgive her now
In a glass of sherry wine
The lights that offer other girls
For empty hearts like mine

They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright
And it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights

The world was dark
God made the stars to brighten up the night
But the guy that put those stars above
I don't believe he made those lights

It's just a place for me to cry
When things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide
Behind those city lights

Lights that say forget her love
In a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but
A masquerade for tears

They paint a pretty picture
Oh, but my arms can't hold on you tight
And I just can't say that I love you
To a street of city lights

No, I just can't say that I love you
To a street of city lights
