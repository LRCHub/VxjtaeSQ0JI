One day
黄昏時 on the highway
I'm stuck in a traffic jam fucking no way
まぁ別に今日急いでないし I'm ok
少しも前へ動けない
踊り出す brake lights
Sunset 染める街 like 異世界
初めての space flight
Some people laughing and some people beeping
Some people smoking like a movie
家路急ぐ reason さまざま
ただいまの時はきっと smile
君を染める空はオレンジで
The destination is right there

Baby
No one makes fun of you
With you everything is so lovely
Inside this fantasy
It's alright lights out
I'll kiss you good night
I'm playing my own quest
I'm on my own plane
Staying here till it fades
後は風まかせ
いつも夜になるの待って
When I start to write with this pen
I feel my heart breathing again
I feel my heart breathing again
I got so many thoughts in my head
それ焚いて手を広げ
Keep going あの終点まで like a bullet train
Don't want a moment of silence
At least I wanna keep whispering
君がいるそれだけで
この夢は広がっていく
*Repeat
Don't know what's waiting ahead
Don't want to be a past tense
Until I see you again
you'll always be my best friend
My thumbs all up
Your thumbs all up
So let me turn the lights out
*Repeat
