I can't believe you're saying
All these things are true
Don't give me an excuse
I don't want to be a stranger
Lying in your room
Because i'm still in love with you
So give me something real
Close my eyes to feel
It kicking in
'Cause when you say you want it
I need you to be honest with me
Before you go
Lights out
So what do you want from me now?
I've said it all before
I can't love you more
I'll never leave this city
But i can't bear to let you go
So please, please, please
Give me something real
Close my eyes to feel
It kicking in
'Cause when you say want it
I need you to be honest with me
Before you go
Lights out
